The Mantevo Project is an effort to create mini-applications that enable design space exploration of key software and algorithm performance attributes in new computing environments, with new programming models and languages and new execution models.  Mini-apps are working code that embody performance impacting elements of large apps, and can be adapted quickly to new environments. I started the Mantevo project in 2007.  Mantevo was a 2013 R&D 100 Award winner.
