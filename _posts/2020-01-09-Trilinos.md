The Trilinos project is a community effort to develop scientific and mathematical libraries that enable the solution of large-scale multi-physics, multi-scale and related modeling and simulation problems on leadership computing platforms. I have led the project since its inception in 2000.  Trilinos was a 2003 R&D 100 Award winner.
