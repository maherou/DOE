The Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Project is focused on creating, curating and collecting resources for the scientific community to improve software practices and products.  BSSw is an outgrowth of the [IDEAS Project](https://ideas-productivity.org) meant to become a universal resource for promoting better practices for scientific software developers and users.  By building communities of software practitioners, we give visibility and recognition to community members who are leading the effort to make scientific software better.  I am one of the BSSw founders and the architect of the GitHub-based content creation model.
